# Epimarks
Everyone loves series. TV shows üì∫, novels üìñ, movies üé¨.

But when we enjoy them online, it's always annoying to remember which EPISODE we were on last time.

You might think "Yay, I can save where I am using BOOKMARKS." But then everytime you watch new episodes, you have to copy the web address, edit the old bookmark, paste the web address and save. Or with __Epimarks__, simply click the smart button ![](assets/epimarked.png), your bookmark is already up-to-date!

Say goodbye to the dumb built-in bookmark star. Welcome Epimarks!
